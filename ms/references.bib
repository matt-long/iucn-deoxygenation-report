@article{Watson-Lenton-etal-2017,
	Abstract = {The major biogeochemical cycles that keep the present-day Earth habitable are linked by a network of feedbacks, which has led to a broadly stable chemical composition of the oceans and atmosphere over hundreds of millions of years. This includes the processes that control both the atmospheric and oceanic concentrations of oxygen. However, one notable exception to the generally well-behaved dynamics of this system is the propensity for episodes of ocean anoxia to occur and to persist for 105--106 years, these ocean anoxic events {(OAEs)} being particularly associated with warm `greenhouse' climates. A powerful mechanism responsible for past {OAEs} was an increase in phosphorus supply to the oceans, leading to higher ocean productivity and oxygen demand in subsurface water. This can be amplified by positive feedbacks on the nutrient content of the ocean, with low oxygen promoting further release of phosphorus from ocean sediments, leading to a potentially self-sustaining condition of deoxygenation. We use a simple model for phosphorus in the ocean to explore this feedback, and to evaluate the potential for humans to bring on global-scale anoxia by enhancing P supply to the oceans. While this is not an immediate global change concern, it is a future possibility on millennial and longer time scales, when considering both phosphate rock mining and increased chemical weathering due to climate change. Ocean deoxygenation, once begun, may be self-sustaining and eventually could result in long-lasting and unpleasant consequences for the Earth's {biosphere.This} article is part of the themed issue {`Ocean} ventilation and deoxygenation in a warming world'.},

Whereas anthropogenic nutrient loading has increased the frequency and severity of hypoxia in estuaries and semi-enclosed seas3,4, the occurrence of hypoxia in open-coast upwelling systems reflects ocean conditions that control the delivery of oxygen-poor and nutrient-rich deep water onto continental shelves1. Upwelling systems support a large proportion of the world's fisheries5, therefore understanding the links between changes in ocean climate, upwelling-driven hypoxia and ecological perturbations is critical. Here we report on the unprecedented development of severe inner-shelf (<70 m) hypoxia and resultant mass die-offs of fish and invertebrates within the California Current System. In 2002, cross-shelf transects revealed the development of abnormally low dissolved-oxygen levels as a response to anomalously strong flow of subarctic water into the California Current System. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of inner-shelf ecosystems to variation in ocean conditions, and the potential impacts of climate change on marine communities.},

@article{Stock-John-etal-2017,
	Abstract = {Photosynthesis fuels marine food webs, yet differences in fish catch across globally distributed marine ecosystems far exceed differences in net primary production {(NPP).} We consider the hypothesis that ecosystem-level variations in pelagic and benthic energy flows from phytoplankton to fish, trophic transfer efficiencies, and fishing effort can quantitatively reconcile this contrast in an energetically consistent manner. To test this hypothesis, we enlist global fish catch data that include previously neglected contributions from small-scale fisheries, a synthesis of global fishing effort, and plankton food web energy flux estimates from a prototype high-resolution global earth system model {(ESM).} After removing a small number of lightly fished ecosystems, stark interregional differences in fish catch per unit area can be explained (r = 0.79) with an energy-based model that (i) considers dynamic interregional differences in benthic and pelagic energy pathways connecting phytoplankton and fish, (ii) depresses trophic transfer efficiencies in the tropics and, less critically, (iii) associates elevated trophic transfer efficiencies with benthic-predominant systems. Model catch estimates are generally within a factor of 2 of values spanning two orders of magnitude. Climate change projections show that the same macroecological patterns explaining dramatic regional catch differences in the contemporary ocean amplify catch trends, producing changes that may exceed 50\% in some regions by the end of the 21st century under high-emissions scenarios. Models failing to resolve these trophodynamic patterns may significantly underestimate regional fisheries catch trends and hinder adaptation to climate change.},

	Abstract = {Sustained metabolic rates {(SusMR)} are time-averaged metabolic rates that are measured in free-ranging animals maintaining constant body mass over periods long enough that metabolism is fueled by food intake rather than by transient depletion of energy reserves. Many authors have suggested that {SusMR} of various wild animal species are only a few times resting (basal or standard) metabolic rates {(RMR).} We test this conclusion by analyzing all 37 species (humans, 31 other endothermic vertebrates, and 5 ectothermic vertebrates) for which {SusMR} and {RMR} had both been measured. For all species, the ratio of {SusMR} to {RMR,} which we term sustained metabolic scope, is less than 7; most values fall between 1.5 and 5. Some of these values, such as those for Tour de France cyclists and breeding birds, are surely close to sustainable metabolic ceilings for the species studied. That is, metabolic rates higher than 7 times {RMR} apparently cannot be sustained indefinitely. These observations pose several questions: whether the proximate physiological causes of metabolic ceilings reside in the digestive tract's ability to process food or in each tissue's metabolic capacity; whether ceiling values are independent of the mode of energy expenditure; whether ceilings are set by single limiting physiological capacities or by coadjusted clusters of capacities (symmorphosis); what the ultimate evolutionary causes of metabolic ceilings are; and how metabolic ceilings may limit animals' reproductive effort, foraging behavior, and geographic distribution.},

	Abstract = {The pattern of global mean temperature {(GMT)} change is calculated by regressing local surface air temperature {(SAT)} to {GMT} for an ensemble of {CMIP5} models and for observations over the last 132 years. Calculations are based on the historical period and climate change scenarios. As in the observations the warming pattern contains a warming hole over the subpolar North Atlantic. Using a bivariate regression of {SAT} to {GMT} and an index of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation {(AMOC),} the warming pattern is decomposed in a radiatively forced part and an {AMOC} fingerprint. The North Atlantic warming hole is associated with a decline of the {AMOC.} The {AMOC} fingerprint resembles Atlantic multidecadal variability {(AMV),} but details of the pattern change when the {AMOC} decline increases, underscoring the nonlinearity in the response. The warming hole is situated south of deep convection sites, indicating that it involves an adjustment of the gyre circulation, although it should be noted that some models feature deep convection in the middle of the subpolar gyre. The warming hole is already prominent in historical runs, where the response of the {AMOC} to {GMT} is weak, which suggests that it is involved in an ocean adjustment that precedes the {AMOC} decline. In the more strongly forced scenario runs, the warming hole over the subpolar gyre becomes weaker, while cooling over the Nordic seas increases, consistent with previous findings that deep convection in the Labrador and Irminger Seas is more vulnerable to changes in external forcing than convection in the Nordic seas, which only reacts after a threshold is passed.},

@article{Gnanadesikan-Russell-etal-2007,
	Abstract = {Since the upper ocean takes up much of the heat added to the earth system by anthropogenic global warming, one would expect that global warming would lead to an increase in stratification and a decrease in the ventilation of the ocean interior. However, multiple simulations in global coupled climate models using an ideal age tracer which is set to zero in the mixed layer and ages at 1 yr/yr outside this layer show that the intermediate depths in the low latitudes, Northwest Atlantic, and parts of the Arctic Ocean become younger under global warming. This paper reconciles these apparently contradictory trends, showing that the decreases result from changes in the relative contributions of old deep waters and younger surface waters. Implications for the tropical oxygen minimum zones, which play a critical role in global biogeochemical cycling are considered in detail.},

@article{Hasselmann-1993,
	Abstract = {Abstract An optimal linear filter (fingerprint) is derived for the detection of a given time-dependent, multivariate climate change signal in the presence of natural climate variability noise. Application of the fingerprint to the observed (or model simulated) climate data yields a climate change detection variable (detector) with maximal signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal fingerprint is given by the product of the assumed signal pattern and the inverse of the climate variability covariance matrix. The data can consist of any, not necessarily dynamically complete, climate dataset for which estimates of the natural variability covariance matrix exist. The single-pattern analysis readily generalizes to the multipattern case of a climate change signal lying in a prescribed (in practice relatively low dimensional) signal pattern space: the single-pattern result is simply applied separately to each individual base pattern spanning the signal pattern space. Multipattern detection methods can be applied either to test the statistical significance of individual components of a predicted multicomponent climate change response, using separate single-pattern detection tests, or to determine the statistical significance of the complete signal, using a multivariate test. Both detection modes make use of the same set of detectors. The difference in direction of the assumed signal pattern and computed optimal fingerprint vector allows alternative interpretations of the estimated signal associated with the set of optimal detectors. The present analysis yields an estimated signal lying in the assumed signal space, whereas an earlier analysis of the time-independent detection problem by Hasselmann yielded an estimated signal in the computed fingerprint space. The different interpretations can be explained by different choices of the metric used to relate the signal space to the fingerprint space (inverse covariance matrix versus standard Euclidean metric, respectively). Two simple natural variability models are considered: a space-time separability model, and an expansion in terms of P0Ps (principal oscillation patterns). For each model the application of the optimal fingerprint method is illustrated by an example.},

	Abstract = {Global ship-based programs, with highly accurate, full water column physical and biogeochemical observations repeated decadally since the 1970s, provide a crucial resource for documenting ocean change. The ocean, a central component of Earth's climate system, is taking up most of Earth's excess anthropogenic heat, with about 19\% of this excess in the abyssal ocean beneath 2,000 m, dominated by Southern Ocean warming. The ocean also has taken up about 27\% of anthropogenic carbon, resulting in acidification of the upper ocean. Increased stratification has resulted in a decline in oxygen and increase in nutrients in the Northern Hemisphere thermocline and an expansion of tropical oxygen minimum zones. Southern Hemisphere thermocline oxygen increased in the 2000s owing to stronger wind forcing and ventilation. The most recent decade of global hydrography has mapped dissolved organic carbon, a large, bioactive reservoir, for the first time and quantified its contribution to export production (∼20\%) and deep-ocean oxygen utilization. Ship-based measurements also show that vertical diffusivity increases from a minimum in the thermocline to a maximum within the bottom 1,500 m, shifting our physical paradigm of the ocean's overturning {circulation.Expected} final online publication date for the Annual Review of Marine Science Volume 8 is January 03, 2016.

	Abstract = {Warming of the oceans and consequent loss of dissolved oxygen (O2) will alter marine ecosystems, but a mechanistic framework to predict the impact of multiple stressors on viable habitat is lacking. Here, we integrate physiological, climatic, and biogeographic data to calibrate and then map a key metabolic index---the ratio of O2 supply to resting metabolic O2 demand---across geographic ranges of several marine ectotherms. These species differ in thermal and hypoxic tolerances, but their contemporary distributions are all bounded at the equatorward edge by a minimum metabolic index of ~2 to 5, indicative of a critical energetic requirement for organismal activity. The combined effects of warming and O2 loss this century are projected to reduce the upper ocean's metabolic index by ~20% globally and by ~50% in northern high-latitude regions, forcing poleward and vertical contraction of metabolically viable habitats and species ranges.},

@article{Gnanadesikan-Dunne-etal-2012,
	Abstract = {Global warming is expected to reduce oxygen solubility and vertical exchange in the ocean, changes which would be expected to result in an increase in the volume of hypoxic waters. A simulation made with a full Earth System model with dynamical atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and biogeochemical cycling (the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's Earth System Model 2.1) shows that this holds true if the condition for hypoxia is set relatively high. However, the volume of the most hypoxic (i.e., suboxic) waters does not increase under global warming, as these waters actually become more oxygenated. We show that the rise in dissolved oxygen in the tropical Pacific is associated with a drop in ventilation time. A term-by-term analysis within the least oxygenated waters shows an increased supply of dissolved oxygen due to lateral diffusion compensating an increase in remineralization within these highly hypoxic waters. This lateral diffusive flux is the result of an increase of ventilation along the Chilean coast, as a drying of the region under global warming opens up a region of wintertime convection in our model. The results highlight the potential sensitivity of suboxic waters to changes in subtropical ventilation as well as the importance of constraining lateral eddy transport of dissolved oxygen in such waters.},

	Abstract = {Apparent Oxygen Utilization {(AOU)} is widely used to infer respiration in the oceans by assuming that surface oxygen concentration is close to saturation with the overlying atmosphere. However, significant disequilibrium of oxygen has been observed in high latitude surface oceans where the deep waters are formed. We explicitly calculate True Oxygen Utilization {(TOU)} in a global ocean physical-biogeochemical model to evaluate the ability of {AOU} to represent respiration. We find significant differences between {AOU} and {TOU} in the deep waters, suggesting a systematic overestimation of respiration when inferred from {AOU.} The surface heat flux and the entrainment of thermocline waters together drive the surface undersaturation of oxygen in the regions of water mass formation, and their influences are significantly enhanced by sea ice cover at high latitudes.},

	Abstract = {Uncertainty in future climate change presents a key challenge for adaptation planning. In this study, uncertainty arising from internal climate variability is investigated using a new 40-member ensemble conducted with the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model Version 3 {(CCSM3)} under the {SRES} {A1B} greenhouse gas and ozone recovery forcing scenarios during 2000--2060. The contribution of intrinsic atmospheric variability to the total uncertainty is further examined using a 10,000-year control integration of the atmospheric model component of {CCSM3} under fixed boundary conditions. The global climate response is characterized in terms of air temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure during winter and summer. The dominant source of uncertainty in the simulated climate response at middle and high latitudes is internal atmospheric variability associated with the annular modes of circulation variability. Coupled ocean-atmosphere variability plays a dominant role in the tropics, with attendant effects at higher latitudes via atmospheric teleconnections. Uncertainties in the forced response are generally larger for sea level pressure than precipitation, and smallest for air temperature. Accordingly, forced changes in air temperature can be detected earlier and with fewer ensemble members than those in atmospheric circulation and precipitation. Implications of the results for detection and attribution of observed climate change and for multi-model climate assessments are discussed. Internal variability is estimated to account for at least half of the inter-model spread in projected climate trends during 2005--2060 in the {CMIP3} multi-model ensemble.},

@article{Landolfi-Somes-etal-2017,
	Abstract = {There is currently no consensus on how humans are affecting the marine nitrogen {(N)} cycle, which limits marine biological production and {CO2} uptake. Anthropogenic changes in ocean warming, deoxygenation, and atmospheric N deposition can all individually affect the marine N cycle and the oceanic production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide {(N2O).} However, the combined effect of these perturbations on marine N cycling, ocean productivity, and marine {N2O} production is poorly understood. Here we use an Earth system model of intermediate complexity to investigate the combined effects of estimated 21st century {CO2} atmospheric forcing and atmospheric N deposition. Our simulations suggest that anthropogenic perturbations cause only a small imbalance to the N cycle relative to preindustrial conditions (∼+5~Tg~N~y−1 in 2100). More N loss from water column denitrification in expanded oxygen minimum zones {(OMZs)} is counteracted by less benthic denitrification, due to the stratification-induced reduction in organic matter export. The larger atmospheric N load is offset by reduced N inputs by marine N2 fixation. Our model predicts a decline in oceanic {N2O} emissions by 2100. This is induced by the decrease in organic matter export and associated {N2O} production and by the anthropogenically driven changes in ocean circulation and atmospheric {N2O} concentrations. After comprehensively accounting for a series of complex physical-biogeochemical interactions, this study suggests that N flux imbalances are limited by biogeochemical feedbacks that help stabilize the marine N inventory against anthropogenic changes. These findings support the hypothesis that strong negative feedbacks regulate the marine N inventory on centennial time scales.},

	Abstract = {Greenhouse-gas emissions have created a planetary energy imbalance that is primarily manifested by increasing ocean heat content {(OHC).} Updated observational estimates of full-depth {OHC} change since 1970 are presented that account for recent advancements in reducing observation errors and biases. The full-depth {OHC} has increased by 0.74 [0.68, 0.80]  {\texttimes}  1022 J yr−1 (0.46 Wm−2) and 1.22 [1.16--1.29]  {\texttimes}  1022 J yr−1 (0.75 Wm−2) for 1970--2005 and 1992--2005, respectively, with a 5 to 95 \% confidence interval of the median. The {CMIP5} models show large spread in {OHC} changes, suggesting that some models are not state-of-the-art and require further improvements. However, the ensemble median has excellent agreement with our observational estimate: 0.68 [0.54--0.82]  {\texttimes}  1022 J yr−1 (0.42 Wm−2) from 1970 to 2005 and 1.25 [1.10--1.41]  {\texttimes}  1022 J yr−1 (0.77 Wm−2) from 1992 to 2005. These results increase confidence in both the observational and model estimates to quantify and study changes in Earth's energy imbalance over the historical period. We suggest that {OHC} be a fundamental metric for climate model validation and evaluation, especially for forced changes (decadal timescales).},

	Abstract = {Observations and model runs indicate trends in dissolved oxygen {(DO)} associated with current and ongoing global warming. However, a large-scale observation-to-model comparison has been missing and is presented here. This study presents a first global compilation of {DO} measurements covering the last 50 yr. It shows declining upper-ocean {DO} levels in many regions, especially the tropical oceans, whereas areas with increasing trends are found in the subtropics and in some subpolar regions. For the Atlantic Ocean south of 20{\textdegree} N, the {DO} history could even be extended back to about 70 yr, showing decreasing {DO} in the subtropical South Atlantic. The global mean {DO} trend between 50{\textdegree} S and 50{\textdegree} N at 300 dbar for the period 1960 to 2010 is --0.066 μmol kg−1 yr−1. Results of a numerical biogeochemical Earth system model reveal that the magnitude of the observed change is consistent with {CO2-induced} climate change. However, the pattern correlation between simulated and observed patterns of past {DO} change is negative, indicating that the model does not correctly reproduce the processes responsible for observed regional oxygen changes in the past 50 yr. A negative pattern correlation is also obtained for model configurations with particularly low and particularly high diapycnal mixing, for a configuration that assumes a {CO2-induced} enhancement of the C : N ratios of exported organic matter and irrespective of whether climatological or realistic winds from reanalysis products are used to force the model. Depending on the model configuration the 300 dbar {DO} trend between 50{\textdegree} S and 50{\textdegree} N is −0.027 to --0.047 μmol kg−1 yr−1 for climatological wind forcing, with a much larger range of --0.083 to +0.027 μmol kg−1 yr−1 for different initializations of sensitivity runs with reanalysis wind forcing. Although numerical models reproduce the overall sign and, to some extent, magnitude of observed ocean deoxygenation, this degree of realism does not necessarily apply to simulated regional patterns and the representation of processes involved in their generation. Further analysis of the processes that can explain the discrepancies between observed and modeled {DO} trends is required to better understand the climate sensitivity of oceanic oxygen fields and predict potential {DO} changes in the future.},

	Abstract = {Changes in upper ocean stratification during the second half of the 21st century, relative to the second half of the 20th century, are examined in ten of the {CMIP3} climate models according to the {SRES-A2} scenario. The upper ocean stratification, defined here as the density difference between 200~m and the surface, is larger everywhere during the second half of the 21st century, indicative of an increasing degree of decoupling between the surface and the deeper oceans, with important consequences for many biogeochemical processes. The areas characterized by the largest stratification changes include the Arctic, the tropics, the North Atlantic, and the northeast Pacific. The increase in stratification is primarily due to the increase in surface temperature, whose influence upon density is largest in the tropical regions, and decreases with increasing latitude. The influence of salinity upon the stratification changes, while not as spatially extensive as that of temperature, is very large in the Arctic, North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific. Salinity also significantly contributes to the density decrease near the surface in the western tropical Pacific, but counteracts the negative influence of temperature upon density in the tropical Atlantic.},

	Abstract = {Changes in marine net primary productivity {(PP)} and export of particulate organic carbon {(EP)} are projected over the 21st century with four global coupled carbon cycle-climate models. These include representations of marine ecosystems and the carbon cycle of different structure and complexity. All four models show a decrease in global mean {PP} and {EP} between 2 and 20\% by 2100 relative to preindustrial conditions, for the {SRES} A2 emission scenario. Two different regimes for productivity changes are consistently identified in all models. The first chain of mechanisms is dominant in the low- and mid-latitude ocean and in the North Atlantic: reduced input of macro-nutrients into the euphotic zone related to enhanced stratification, reduced mixed layer depth, and slowed circulation causes a decrease in macro-nutrient concentrations and in {PP} and {EP.} The second regime is projected for parts of the Southern Ocean: an alleviation of light and/or temperature limitation leads to an increase in {PP} and {EP} as productivity is fueled by a sustained nutrient input. A region of disagreement among the models is the Arctic, where three models project an increase in {PP} while one model projects a decrease. Projected changes in seasonal and interannual variability are modest in most regions. Regional model skill metrics are proposed to generate multi-model mean fields that show an improved skill in representing observation-based estimates compared to a simple multi-model average. Model results are compared to recent productivity projections with three different algorithms, usually applied to infer net primary production from satellite observations.},

	Abstract = {As particulate organic carbon rains down from the surface ocean it is respired back to carbon dioxide and released into the ocean's interior. The depth at which this sinking carbon is converted back to carbon dioxide---known as the remineralization depth---depends on the balance between particle sinking speeds and their rate of decay. A host of climate-sensitive factors can affect this balance, including temperature1, oxygen concentration2, stratification, community composition3, 4 and the mineral content of the sinking particles5. Here we use a three-dimensional global ocean biogeochemistry model to show that a modest change in remineralization depth can have a substantial impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. For example, when the depth at which 63\% of sinking carbon is respired increases by 24~m globally, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall by 10--27~ppm. This reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration results from the redistribution of remineralized carbon from intermediate waters to bottom waters. As a consequence of the reduced concentration of respired carbon in upper ocean waters, atmospheric carbon dioxide is preferentially stored in newly formed North Atlantic Deep Water. We suggest that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are highly sensitive to the potential changes in remineralization depth that may be caused by climate change.},

@article{Long-Deutsch-etal-2016,
	Abstract = {Anthropogenically forced trends in oceanic dissolved oxygen are evaluated in Earth system models in the context of natural variability. A large ensemble of a single Earth system model is used to clearly identify the forced component of change in interior oxygen distributions and to evaluate the magnitude of this signal relative to noise generated by internal climate variability. The time of emergence of forced trends is quantified on the basis of anomalies in oxygen concentrations and trends. We find that the forced signal should already be evident in the southern Indian Ocean and parts of the eastern tropical Pacific and Atlantic basins; widespread detection of forced deoxygenation is possible by 2030--2040. In addition to considering spatially discrete metrics of detection, we evaluate the similarity of the spatial structures associated with natural variability and the forced trend. Outside of the subtropics, these patterns are not wholly distinct on the isopycnal surfaces considered, and therefore, this approach does not provide significantly advanced detection. Our results clearly demonstrate the strong impact of natural climate variability on interior oxygen distributions, providing an important context for interpreting observations.},

@article{Gruber-2011,
	Abstract = {In the coming decades and centuries, the ocean's biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems will become increasingly stressed by
                     at least three independent factors. Rising temperatures, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation will cause substantial
                     changes in the physical, chemical and biological environment, which will then affect the ocean's biogeochemical cycles and
                     ecosystems in ways that we are only beginning to fathom. Ocean warming will not only affect organisms and biogeochemical cycles
                     directly, but will also increase upper ocean stratification. The changes in the ocean's carbonate chemistry induced by the
                     uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide {(CO2)} (i.e. ocean acidification) will probably affect many organisms and processes, although in ways that are currently not well
                     understood. Ocean deoxygenation, i.e. the loss of dissolved oxygen {(O2)} from the ocean, is bound to occur in a warming and more stratified ocean, causing stress to macro-organisms that critically
                     depend on sufficient levels of oxygen. These three stressors---warming, acidification and deoxygenation---will tend to operate
                     globally, although with distinct regional differences. The impacts of ocean acidification tend to be strongest in the high
                     latitudes, whereas the low-oxygen regions of the low latitudes are most vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation. Specific regions,
                     such as the eastern boundary upwelling systems, will be strongly affected by all three stressors, making them potential hotspots
                     for change. Of additional concern are synergistic effects, such as ocean acidification-induced changes in the type and magnitude
                     of the organic matter exported to the ocean's interior, which then might cause substantial changes in the oxygen concentration
                     there. Ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation are essentially irreversible on centennial time scales, i.e. once these
                     changes have occurred, it will take centuries for the ocean to recover. With the emission of {CO2} being the primary driver behind all three stressors, the primary mitigation strategy is to reduce these emissions.
